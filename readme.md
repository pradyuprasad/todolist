This is a small todolist app written with a go backend and a react frontend

Roadmap to be done

Backend stuff
1. ~~allow user to create todos if they have logged in~~ /
new thing: ensure user can't login twice
2. view todos
3. delete todos

Front end stuff
1. use React (for the first time yay!)
2. make it look nice

Security stuff
1. hash passwords
2. username and password validation for create user
2a. Username validation meaning check if username is not in and create special alert for that
2b. Password validation: length and characters

final depoloyment
1. upload to heroku or someplace??
